## Description
Minimap generator from Age Of Empires 2 savegames.

## Features
Vesion 1.0, working perfectly.

- Generate minimap from a saved game (.mgl, .mgx, .mgz and .aoe2record files).

- Rotate the map and add transparency to the background.

- Display the location of each player.

- Display the piles of gold and stone resources.

- Display the food resorces (berry bushes, animals like sheeps, fishes, boars, etc.)

- Display Relics on the minimap

## Dependencies
- [mgz](https://github.com/happyleavesaoc/aoc-mgz) (Also via pip: `pip install mgz`)
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html). (also via pip: `pip install Pillow`)

## Usage
Place the saved games in the same path as the Python script files, **after having installed the necessary dependencies**, run the Python script **"minimap_generator.py"**, voilà, minimap images will be generated, displayed and saved in the same directory.

## Installing Dependencies
Try these commands until you find one that works for you (this is because each linux distro is very picky), one of them should be suitable for you. [source: this question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20060096/installing-pil-with-pip)
