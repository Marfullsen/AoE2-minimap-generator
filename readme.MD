## Dependencies
- [mgz](https://github.com/happyleavesaoc/aoc-mgz) (Also via pip: `pip install mgz`)
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html). (also via pip: `pip install Pillow`)

## Usage
First, make sure you have **Python3** installed on your machine.

Place the saved games **in the same path as the Python script**, then **after having installed the necessary dependencies** run the Python script **"main.py"**, voilà, minimap images will be generated, displayed and saved in the same directory.

You could also move the python script called 'main.py' to your folder with the savesgames, run the script and it should work.

## Installing Dependencies
Try these commands until you find one that works for you (this is because each linux distro is very picky), one of them should be suitable for you. [source: this question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20060096/installing-pil-with-pip)

**Linux**
```
sudo pip3 install pillow
sudo python3 -m pip install pillow

```

**Windows**
```
pip install Pillow
```
